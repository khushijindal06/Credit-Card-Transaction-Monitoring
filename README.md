# Credit-Card-Transaction-Monitoring
## 1. Introduction:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to create a powerful machine-learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Within machine learning, the field of "Anomaly Detection" includes credit card fraud detection. For financial institutions as well as individuals, credit card fraud represents a major financial risk. This project uses the Random Forest algorithm, a potent machine-learning method well-known for its efficiency in classification tasks, to solve this problem. The main objective is to develop a prediction model that minimizes false positives and can detect fraudulent transactions with accuracy.
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both financial institutions and cardholders. As technology advances, so do the methods employed by fraudsters. Credit card fraud detection has become a crucial application of data science and machine learning. The goal is to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions in real-time, minimizing financial losses and ensuring the security of financial systems.

## 2) Background:

The increasing prevalence of credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions and cardholders alike. Traditional methods of fraud detection often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic and sophisticated tactics employed by fraudsters. In this context, we aim to develop an advanced credit card fraud detection system leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy and minimize false positives.

## 3) Objectives:

Imbalanced Data Handling:

Address the challenge posed by imbalanced data, where fraudulent transactions represent a minority class, leading to potential bias in the model. Develop strategies to handle this class imbalance and improve model performance.

Model Development:

Utilize machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to train a robust fraud detection model. Leverage the algorithm's ability to learn patterns from historical data to identify potential fraudulent activities.

Performance Metrics:

Evaluate the effectiveness of the model using appropriate performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, prioritize metrics that consider false positives and false negatives.

## 4) Dataset overview:
The dataset we have used is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset comprises transactions that occurred over two days, encompassing 284,807 transactions. Within this dataset are 492 instances of fraud, highlighting the imbalanced nature of fraud occurrences against legitimate transactions.
